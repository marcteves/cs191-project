# Before working, make sure you're working on a copy of the repository you
# forked from the original, and not the original repository itself.

### STARTING FROM FORKED REPOSITORY: WORKING ON NEW FEATURE ###

# Move HEAD to testing branch
git checkout test

# Create new branch starting at current HEAD
git branch <feature_branch>

# Move HEAD to that branch
git checkout <feature_branch>

# Now you can do some work
git add <files>
git commit

# Push to upstream when you're ready to make the pull request or you want to
# save your work remotely
# This also creates a remote equivalent of <feature_branch> on the github
# repository.
git push -u origin <feature_branch>

# You can now do the pull request on github.com

### CONTINUING UNFINISHED FEATURE ###
# If you did the above steps already, but didn't make it to pushing and
# making the pull request, this is how you continue working.

# Make sure you're working on the feature branch you've made
git status

# If not, move your HEAD to the feature branch
git checkout <feature_branch>

# Continue working as normal
git add <files>
git commit

# Push when you feel that you're done
# There's no need to add -u switch anymore since you already set-up the
# remote branch
git push

### DOING THE PULL REQUEST ###
# Make sure to do this from your own github.com repository
# See the video in the workflow/ folder for details
# BASE: <testing_branch> <- COMPARE: <feature_branch>
